# From Code to Computation: A Modern Guide to Programming and Theory

> *.. it isn’t just another programming book--it’s a journey. Learn programming the modern way: not by memorising syntax, but by building, experimenting, and exploring how computers really work. From your first lines of Python, C, and JavaScript, you’ll dive into virtual machines, compilers, debugging, optimisation, and even hands-on hardware projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico. Along the way, Large Language Models (LLMs) become your interactive mentors—offering instant feedback, code suggestions, and explanations—while you push deeper into real-world programming challenges.*

> *This book is for programmers ready to go beyond the basics: to understand how code becomes computation, how abstractions shape software, and how AI is transforming the craft of programming itself. Steep? Yes. Rewarding? Absolutely. Build. Break. Learn. Repeat.*



This repository is primarily to be used as a companion to the book
*From Code to Computation: A Modern Guide to Programming and Theory*

Here you should be able to find more information, errata, exercises, code,
other resources and updates.


A teaser for the book in PDF: [FFrom Code to Computation](./book/README.md).

Some of the [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
podcast episodes have been produced, here on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6urznNfbNTV33HOPJ7mcbQ?si=U1r_G6ySSGmQCHZqvbL4bw).

The [workbook](./workbook) consists mainly of:

* Examples in __*code*__ that were both too extensive to be published in
the book, and complete code. The code has also been described in text at
places where it may add to previous code and description.

* Also ideas for additional __*projects*__, some discussions and exercises
can be found.

A discussion on [teching and learning](./teach/) in relation to the book and workbook.
A [Teacher's Manual](./teach/TEACH.md) gives some advice on how to use the
book/workbook in a classroom setting, or equivalent.

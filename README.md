# From Code to Computation: A Modern Guide to Programming and Theory

This material--this GitHub repository and the printed book--is offered as a contribution to the broader conversation about how emerging educational tools, including large language models, may influence teaching and learning. The printed book is not meant to be a finished textbook. Instead, its textbook-like structure serves as an *example* of how digital tools can be woven directly into educational content.

The approach follows ideas associated with such thinkers as John Dewey, who argued that education should grow from active inquiry and concrete problem-solving rather than passive absorption of facts. His emphasis on experience and reflection suggests that tools enabling experimentation (here: from simulations to interactive code) can strengthen project-based and enquiry-driven learning. In such a setting, large language models may act as scaffolding, helping students explore questions, test ideas, and vary their projects while leaving the essential intellectual work in their hands.

For decades, computer science has been a world of order and predictability, where machines obey instructions with perfect precision. But as artificial intelligence grows, that mechanical certainty begins to shift. This book traces that movement---from the crisp logic of algorithms and virtual machines to the fluid reasoning of adaptive systems---and treats programming as a craft of thought: a dialogue between human intention and computational possibility.

Through project-based exploration, you'll experiment, build, and engage with modern tools, including Large Language Models, while sharpening your analytical and critical reasoning skills. With some programming experience and a foundation in computer science, you'll expand both your practical skills and your understanding of the principles shaping modern computing.

*Set Lonnert has been exploring, teaching, and writing about computers since the the year 1980, publishing widely on programming, early internet technologies, and web development, and embracing new platforms as they emerge. This book reflects his lifelong dedication to understanding---and sharing---the evolving world of computation.*

This repository is primarily to be used as a companion to the book
*From Code to Computation: A Modern Guide to Programming and Theory*

Here you should be able to find more information, errata, exercises, code,
other resources and updates.

This workbook consists mainly of:

* Examples in __*code*__ that were both too extensive to be published in
  the book, and complete code. The code has also been described in text at
  places where it may add to previous code and description.

* Also ideas for additional __*projects*__, some discussions and exercises
  can be found.

> Download this as an archive and store it on an SD card taped to the inside of the book.  
That way you have a preserved snapshot of the material, even if the online archive changes in the future while the printed book does not.

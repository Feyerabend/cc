## Teaching / Learning

In a classroom working through the second chapter on virtual machines, the material can
initially be presented in a traditional teacher–student format, with a lecture used to
establish the core ideas and terminology. This introductory framing is useful, but the
primary emphasis remains on project-based learning, where students actively design,
implement, and test components of their own virtual machines. The classroom activities
should therefore shift quickly from exposition to hands-on exploration, guided experimentation,
and structured exercises.

Large language models may be introduced as supportive tools--for example, to clarify concepts,
illustrate alternative designs, or provide quick feedback on student questions—but they
should not be relied upon extensively, at this time. The main learning outcomes are best
achieved when students engage directly with the material through their own implementations
and problem-solving efforts.

Some ideas on how to proceed can be found in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

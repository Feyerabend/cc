## Teaching / Learning

This chapter introduces the core practices of debugging, testing, optimisation, error handling,
and the use of development tools. These topics invite both *individual* reflection and *collaborative*
work, since understanding code quality benefits from multiple perspectives. In a future where
large language models may reliably generate code, the act of checking and validating that code
may become even more important. Code that appears correct can still contain hidden faults, and
such faults may remain unnoticed for a long time after the code has been written. Subtle errors
are often the most difficult to detect, and they can resist careful investigation unless systematic
techniques are applied. Testing can come in many forms, be done in many ways. These topics and
many more are explored in the chapter.

Ideas on projects can be found in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) and [PLAN2.md](PLAN2.md).

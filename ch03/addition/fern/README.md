## Recreational Programming

*Recreational programming* is programming done *for fun* rather than for work, school, or
practical necessity. It's similar to "hobby coding," but the term often emphasises creativity,
experimentation, and playfulness.


### Solving puzzles for enjoyment

People work on algorithmic puzzles, coding challenges, or math-oriented problems simply because
they find them enjoyable--like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or coding riddle sites.


### Making small, quirky, or artistic programs

Examples:
* toy programs (e.g., fractal generators, cellular automata)
* code art or demoscene pieces
* weird languages (esolangs like Brainfuck or Piet)


### Exploring unusual or impractical ideas

Some recreational programmers build:
* interpreters for fantasy programming languages
* tiny compilers
* programs that fit in minimal character counts ("code golf")
* simulations of imaginary worlds


### Learning for curiosity's sake

Many people tinker with new languages, paradigms, or frameworks without any
actual need--just to explore.



### Why people do it?
* It's fun and mentally stimulating
* It sharpens problem-solving skills
* It encourages creativity and discovery
* It builds intuition for programming concepts without pressure

## On-Screen Display OSD

As you can see from the code, the menu button are not working as they should/could.
This should be a relatively easy fix, but you could also prolong ideas on how
to use this further, as a project.


### Gaming & Entertainment

*Retro Game Settings Menu*
You could create a handheld retro gaming device settings interface. Add menu
items for controlling emulation speed, save states, screen filters (scanlines,
CRT effects), and button mapping. The menu system is perfect for pause-menu
style interfaces.

*Music Player Controller*
Build a standalone MP3 player interface with menus for playlist management,
equalizer settings (bass, treble, balance), playback modes (shuffle, repeat),
and volume control. The value adjusters would work great for EQ sliders.
Or just simulate the player.

*Digital Photo Frame*
Create a smart photo frame with menus to control slideshow timing, transition
effects, brightness schedules, and photo filters. You could add toggle options
for clock overlay, weather display, and auto-rotate.


### Practical Tools

*Environmental Monitor Dashboard*
Build a sensor monitoring station with configurable alerts. Use the menu to set
temperature/humidity thresholds, calibrate sensors, enable/disable alerts, and
adjust display refresh rates. The value items are perfect for threshold adjustments.

*Workshop Timer System*
Create a multi-timer system for workshop tasks (3D printing, resin curing, paint
drying). Menu could control timer presets, alarm sounds, countdown displays, and
auto-start sequences.

*Smart Desk Controller*
If you have motorized standing desk or RGB lighting, build a control panel with
presets for desk heights, lighting scenes, focus timer modes, and schedule automation.


### Home Automation

*Thermostat Interface*
Design a smart thermostat controller with menus for scheduling, temperature setpoints,
fan modes, and energy-saving profiles. The menu's toggle and value items map perfectly
to HVAC controls.

*Aquarium Controller*
Build an aquarium management system with menus for light schedules (dawn/dusk simulation),
feeding timers, filter maintenance reminders, and water parameter logging.

*Garden Irrigation Controller*
Create a watering system interface with zone controls, schedule management, moisture sensor
calibration, and weather-based adjustments.


### Creative Projects

*LED Matrix Pattern Editor*
If you add an LED matrix, use the menu to select animation patterns, adjust speed/brightness,
save custom sequences, and create color palettes. This would be a fun visual companion to
your menu system.

*Macro Keypad*
Build a programmable macro pad where the menu lets you configure each button's action,
create profiles for different applications, adjust key repeat rates, and manage shortcuts.


You can easily prototype these ideas--just add new menu items and callbacks without
rebuilding the UI from scratch. The toggle and value adjustment features make it really
versatile for any project that needs user configuration!
